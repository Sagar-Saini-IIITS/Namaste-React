A. Summary of Chapter
   
   - writing comment in jsx : { // javascript }
   - we must have one parent while writing in jsx.
   - we can add div as parent but that sometimes results in extra element in DOM and is of no use.
   - We use react fragments as parent and wrap everything inside them.
     Syntax:
            <React.fragment> </React.fragment>
            <> </> (shorthand)
   - JSX,ES6 not mandatory but we use for own convenience.
   - we can write inline style css:
     <div style={{color:"blue"}}> </div>
      or
     const obj={color:"blue"}
     <div style{obj}> </div>
   - Config Driven UI: Approach in which we build UI so that we can target different groups of 
                       user with different UI configurations.
   - props (properties), helpful in passing data to component.
   - optional chaining(?.): it shows up undefined instead of error if object's property/fn value is null
                         or undefined on accessing.
                         animal.dog?.name
                         animal.getname?.()
   - destructuring data or props
   - spread operator : The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existin
                 array or object into another array or object. 
   - map is best way to loop.
   - Virtual DOM- representation of actual DOM
   - Reconciliation: algo used to find out diff bw tree of actual and virtual dom and updates
                     whats need to be updated.  
   - React Fiber - React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm.
   - Keys helps in uniquely identifying elements in react and improves performance when we have children with
      same name/tag.
   - Its not recommended to use index as keys.
   - We might face following issues when we use index value as key attribute when creating a list:
         Performance Issues due to unnecessary re-renders.
         Issues in data mapping in case list items are sorted, filtered, or deleted.
