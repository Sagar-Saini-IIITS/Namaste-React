A. Summary of Chapter
   
   - Exporting of fn comp can be done in two ways, Named and Default.
   - Named export: we can have multiple named export in a file
      export const Title = () =>{

      }
   - Default export: we can only have one default export.
      const Title = ()=>{}
      export default Title;
   - Importing named export:
      import {Title} from './xyz/Title'
   - Importing default export
      import TItle from './xyz/Title'
   - to import all named export in one line:
      import * as obj from './xyz'
   - good practise to put hard coded data in separate file. (config.js/constans.js)
   - React Hooks: just a js function which provides some functionalities
   - useState() Hook: helps in creating state variable which helps in managing state of app.
